	<h2 align="center"><strong>Biography</strong></h2>
	<p>I am 16 and in my senior year of high school at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/flako-wit-da-drako/tvf-bitch" target="_blank">ACTvF</a>. I've lived in Manhattan my whole life. Going to this school I thought that my future career was going to be in the film industry because that's what my whole family does, my mom works for a medical company called <a href="https://www.fcbhealthnetwork.com/" target="_blank">DraftFCB</a> and is the producer for a lot of their commercials. My <a href="https://www.evananthonypost.com/" target="_blank">dad</a> is a freelance color corrector and editor and mostly works on documentaries. My mind was changed when I found interest in business and finance.</p>
	
	<h2 align="center">Technology</h2>
	<p>On a daily basis I use my phone which is an <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">iPhone X</a>. Another piece of technology that I use is my computer/pc that I built myself early freshman year. I also happen to know how to code and I've been coding since middle school, never really did HTML stuff mostly C++ and used it to make cheats for games and sell them but yeah.</p>
